# 200714 Html Forms Graded Classwork

## Score : 3/5
Very well done for your grid implementation! Super close match to the image. You are missing some core requirements for a header and footer and that would change your grid implenentation some and your email field is not of the correct type. Thanks for agreeing to share your solution with the class and for your comment the CSS!

## Assignment
- Recreate `html_form.png`
- Page background should be blue
